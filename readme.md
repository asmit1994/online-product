## Challenges faced in the development of the project:
   - Choosing the Laravel framework was itself one of the major challenges to me as I had never developed a project using any php framework nor any of the CMS platforms.
   - Designing the database was also a difficult task as the tables had to have a proper relations in order to feature all the functionality of the project.
   - I really had a hard time differentiating the scope of administrator and the normal users.
   - The all time pressure for me throughout the development of the project was of course the short span of time I was given to build the project.


## Overcoming the challenges:
   - I found the laravel documentation very helpful with every individual methods stated neatly and easy to understand.
   - I also had a good help from a friend at college who has quite an experience with projects in laravel platform.
   - I referred to some of the similar project examples found on the site "https://laracasts.com/"
   - I also referred to some youtube video tutorials about building similar project using laravel framework.
   
   
## New techs I learned throughout the development of the project:
   - Gulp
   - Npm
   - Laravel
   - Laravel-Elixir
   - MVC Framework
   - Dependency Injection Technique 
   
   
## Managing the time and pressure:
   - I had a hard time managing the time and pressure as the first day of the time span given to me was gone without even getting to start the project. I did a lot of research through different blog and sites looking for  a proper solution to my problem.
   - I followed some of the step-by-step examples to understand what I was about to do and that aso helped me build the confidence to tackle the pressure.
   - Since I'm a final year bachelor student, I also had some of the tasks from college's final year project that overlapped along with this project. Despite it, I gave as much time as possible in the development of the project with all my effort.
